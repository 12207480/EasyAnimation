Intro
========

`UIView.animateWithDuration:animations:` is really easy to use and you're so familiar with its syntax that you often want it to do just a bit more for you automatically. But it doesn't and you need to import *Bloated.framework* by *Beginner Ninja Coder* in order to make a bit more advanced animations than what `animateWithDuration:animations:` allows you to.

**EasyAnimation** extends what UIKit offers in terms of animations and makes your life much easier because you can do much more without learning some perky new syntax.

Easy Layer Animations
========

**EasyAnimation** allows you to animate your layers straight from `animateWithDuration:animations:`. No more `CABasicAnimation` code for you. Just adjust the properties of your layers from within the `animations` block and **EasyAnimation** will take care of the rest:
<table width="100%">
<th>CoreAnimation</th>
<th>EasyAnimation</th>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

```Swift
    let anim = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position.x")
    anim.fromValue = 100.0
    anim.toValue = 200.0
    anim.duration = 2.0
    view.layer.addAnimation(anim, forKey: nil)
```

</td>
<td valign="top">
```swift
    UIView.animateWithDuration(2.0, animations: {
        self.view.layer.position.x = 200.0
    })
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Or if you need to specify delay, animation options and/or animation curve:

<table width="100%">
<th>CoreAnimation</th>
<th>EasyAnimation</th>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

    let anim = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position.x")
    anim.fromValue = 100.0
    anim.toValue = 200.0
    anim.duration = 2.0
    anim.fillMode = kCAFillModeBackwards
    anim.beginTime = CACurrentMediaTime() + 2.0
    anim.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: 
        kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut)
    anim.repeatCount = Float.infinity
    anim.autoreverses = true
    view.layer.addAnimation(anim, forKey: nil)
</td>
<td valign="top">

    UIView.animateWithDuration(2.0, delay: 2.0, 
        options: .Repeat | .Autoreverse | .CurveEaseOut, 
        animations: {
        self.view.layer.position.x = 200.0
    }, completion: nil)
</td>
</tr>
</table>

And if you want to execute a piece of code after the animation is completed - good luck setting up your animation delegate and writing the delegate methods. 

With **EasyAnimation** you just put your code as the `completion` parameter value and **EasyAnimation** executes it for you when your animation completes.

Spring Layer Animations
========
One thing I really miss when using CoreAnimation and `CABasicAnimation` is that there's no easy way to create spring animations. Luckily a handy library called `RBBAnimation` provides an excellent implementation of spring animations for layers - I translated the code to Swift and included `RBBSpringAnimation` into `EasyAnimation`. 

Here's how the code to create a spring animation for the layer position and corner radius looks like:

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top">

    UIView.animateWithDuration(2.0, delay: 0.0, 
      usingSpringWithDamping: 0.25, 
      initialSpringVelocity: 0.0, 
      options: nil, 
      animations: {
        self.view.layer.position.x = 200.0
        self.view.layer.cornerRadius = 50.0
    }, completion: nil)

</td>
</tr>
</table>

[Sam Davies](https://github.com/sammyd) collaborated on the spring animations code. Thanks a ton - I couldn't have figured this one on my own!

Chain Animations
========

`animateWithDuration:animations:` is really handy but chaining one animation after another is a major pain (especially if we are talking about more than 2 animations).

**EasyAnimation** allows you to use a method to just chain two or more animations together.  Call `animateAndChainWithDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:` and then chain to it more animations like this:

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top">

    UIView.animateAndChainWithDuration(1.0, delay: 0.0, 
      options: nil, animations: {
        self.view.center.y += 100
    }, completion: nil).animateWithDuration(1.0, animations: {
        self.view.center.x += 100
    }).animateWithDuration(1.0, animations: {
        self.view.center.y -= 100
    }).animateWithDuration(1.0, animations: {
        self.view.center.x -= 100
    })
</td>
</tr>
</table>

*Yes - that works, give it a try in your project :]*

This code will animate the view along a rectangular path - first downwards, then to the right, then up, then to the initial point where the animation started.

What a perfect oportunity to repeat the animation and make the animation run continuosly! Add `options` parameter to the last `animateWithDuration...` in the chain and turn on the `.Repeat` option. 

This will make the whole chain (e.g. the 4 animations) repeat continuosly.

If you want to pause between any two animations in the chain - just use the `delay` parameter and it will all just work.

Installation
========

* To install the library via Cocoapods (recommended) add to your project's **Podfile**:

`pod 'EasyAnimation'`

* To install with the source code - clone this repo or download the source code as a zip file. Include all files within the `EasyAnimation` folder into your project.

To Do
=========

* polish spring animation to look exactly like the UIKit one
* add `CALayer.animateWithDuration:animations:`.. for the people who want to use different methods for view and layer animations
* `.Autoreverse` for chain animations (if possible)
* cool demos...
